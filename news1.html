<h2>UP Coach Madrid suspended for 2 games!</h2>
                    <h3>The University of the Philippines Fighting Maroons are still looking for their first victory of the 77th Season of the UAAP and their road just got tougher as head coach Rey Madrid was slapped a two-game suspension for questioning the credibility of a referee after their loss to the University of Santo Tomas Growling Tigers last Saturday. Jasmine Payo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer tweeted that UAAP Commissioner Andy Jao confirmed the suspension. <br>
                      <br>
  &quot;I think it&rsquo;s too harsh because I wasn't expecting to be given with such sanction. I already apologized for what I have done and even talked to him personally,&quot; Madrid told Yahoo Philippines. &quot;I just aired my view on what can be improved on the officiating. If this is their action, I need some clarification. I plan to appeal the suspension and I also want to talk to him [UAAP Commissioner Jao] again.&quot;<br>
  <br>
                      Madrid will sit out the two games of the Maroons against the De La Salle University Green Archers on August 6 and against the Adamson University Falcons on August 9 to close out the first round of the eliminations.<br>

  &ldquo;Ang dami niyang tawag nung patapos na &lsquo;yung laban na sana hindi na dapat tinatawag pa. Tanggap na naman namin &lsquo;yung talo kaso parang gusto niya paiskorin pa ng paiskorin &lsquo;yung UST,&rdquo; saidMadrid about referee Ian Borbe.<br>
  <br>
                      Borbe is the same referee suspended by the NCAA after an altercation with Letran guard Mark Cruz.&ldquo;Bahala na siya (Borbe) kung ano &lsquo;yung gusto niya. Basta I&rsquo;m not comfortable with him. Hindi ko siya pinepersonal pero hindi ko lang talaga maisip bakit pa niya ginawa &lsquo;yung mga ganung tawag,&rdquo; said Madrid.</h3>
