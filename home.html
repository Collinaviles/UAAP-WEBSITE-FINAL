					<h2>UP Coach Madrid suspended for 2 games!</h2>
                    <h3>The University of the Philippines Fighting Maroons are still looking for their first victory of the 77th Season of the UAAP and their road just got tougher as head coach Rey Madrid was slapped a two-game suspension for questioning the credibility of a referee after their loss to the University of Santo Tomas Growling Tigers last Saturday.</h3>

                  <h2>UAAP Season 77 Champ!</h2>
                    <h3>UAAP Season 77 may only be halfway done, but for National University it is already an unforgettable one as six of their teams have garnered gold medals in their respective sports. Headlining this list of champions is the NU Men's Basketball team that ended a 60-year title drought, after beating Far Eastern University in Game 3 of their Finals series last October 15, 2014. In order to celebrate this momentous achievement, the entire NU community held a huge party at the activity center inside the NU campus in Sampaloc, Manila last Thursday, October 23, 2014.</h3>
