        <h2>Adamson scores breakthrough win vs UP<br>
        </h2>
        <h3>Rookie coach Kenneth Duremdes was unable to hide his elation after Adamson University scored its breakthrough win: a 67-63 squeaker over University of the Philippines in the 77th UAAP men&rsquo;s basketball tournament Tuesday at the Araneta Coliseum.<br>
          <br>
          Holding back tears, Duremdes visited the press room for the first time as the Soaring Falcons arrested a 17-game losing streak with a valiant conquest of the Fighting Maroons.<br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Ganito pala dito?&rdquo; said Duremdes before addressing reporters in what he called a &ldquo;sweet victory&rdquo; for him and his young team. <br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Tears of joy,&rdquo; the former PBA superstar said. &ldquo;We ended the season on a winning note. This is all for the three guys who will graduate this year. Ito yung game na dinedicate namin sa kanila.&rdquo; <br>
          <br>
          After a slow start that saw them trail by 12 in the opening period, Adamson recovered and bludgeoned UP in the middle quarters, holding the Maroons to just 21 points while firing 38 markers of their own. <br>
          <br>
          Graduating veterans Don Trollano, Jansen Rios, and Ryan Monteclaro played big roles in that stretch, combining for 24 points as they took a 50-45 advantage heading into the final canto. <br>
          <br>
          The Falcons then opened the period on a sizzling 7-0 run to take full control at 57-45, before the Diliman cagers came charging back with an 18-6 blast of their own to tie it at 63-all after two free-throws by rookie Diego Dario. <br>
          <br>
          Dawn Ochea, however, quickly scored in the ensuing play, and UP could only set up a well-contested Mikee Reyes three-pointer that didn&rsquo;t find the bottom of the net in the dying seconds. <br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Nangyari yung gusto naming mangyari from the start,&rdquo; Duremdes added. &ldquo;Nung palapit na nung palapit yung end ng season, umaabot na kami ng third quarter. Tapos this game, umabot na kami ng fourth quarter.&rdquo; <br>
          <br>
          Trollano led all scorers with 21 points and 12 rebounds in his last UAAP game while Rios and Monteclaro also bade their collegiate careers goodbye by combining for 18 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. <br>
          <br>
          Dario posted 13 points, Kyles Lao added 11 markers and Mo Gingerich had 10 points for the Maroons, whose rally just fell short in the end game. <br>
          <br>
          The scores:<br>
          <br>
          Adamson (67) — Trollano 21, Rios 11, Ochea 9, Monteclaro 7, Polican 5, Villanueva 5, Inigo 4, Pedrosa 3, Barrera 2, Garcia 0, Nalos 0, Aquino 0, Baytan 0<br>
          <br>
          UP (63) — Dario 13, Lao 11, Gingerich 10, Reyes 9, Moralde 8, Gallarza 7, Juruena 3, Asilum 2, Vito 0, Harris 0<br>
          <br>
        Quarters: 12-24, 25-30, 50-45, 67-63</h3>
